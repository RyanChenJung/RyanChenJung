# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan Chen

I am a **Data Scientist with Product Thinking** and a **Former Entrepreneur**. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex technical models and real-world business impact.

My philosophy is simple: **Technology shouldn't just be used; it must be purposeful.** Models shouldn't just be trained; they must serve a specific pain point and deliver measurable commercial value.

I am a strong believer in **Rapid Prototyping and Hypothesis Validation.** I often challenge my own assumptions by building MVPs to test new ideas. If a prototype fails to solve the core pain point or lacks clear business impact, I am not afraid to pivot and dismantle my original concept. To me, identifying what *doesn't* work is just as valuable as finding what *does* in the pursuit of the most effective solution.

With a background as a 2x Founder and Product Manager, I bring a unique perspective to data science—combining analytical rigor with a strategic mindset.

**Currently pursuing M.S. in Applied Data Science at The University of Chicago (Dec 2026).**
